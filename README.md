# Stardew Valley Cooking Planner
[Stardew Valley Cooking Planner](https://digzol.github.io/stardew-cooking-planner/) is a tool to help Stardew Valley players achieve the 'Gourmet Chef' achievement which involves cooking every recipe in the game.

The app tracks which recipes have been completed, and supplies a list of every ingredient required to complete the remaining recipes.
The ingredient list is recursive, meaning ingredients which have a recipe will list its ingredients along the recipe result itself.

Support for [Stardew Valley Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753) and [Ridgeside Village](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7286) mods are available.

This app was made in React 18.2.0.
